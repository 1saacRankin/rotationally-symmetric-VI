# Variational Inference in Location-Scale Families: Exact Recovery of the Mean and Correlation Matrix
Charles C. Margossian and  Lawrence K. Saul


We show that VI recovers the mean of the target density p when p exhibits a rotational symmetry.
That is, if $p(\mu + z) = p(\mu + Rz)$ for some rotation matrix $R$ and $Q$ is a spherically symmetric location family, then there exists a unique minimizer of the KL divergence from $q$ to $p$ when the points of symmetry coincide.
